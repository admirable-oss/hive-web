# Roadmap

> **Hive** — AI infrastructure for always-working agents.  
> Site: [https://hive.admir-saheta.com](https://hive.admir-saheta.com)

Each milestone ships a tagged release and has clear acceptance criteria, so you always know when it's truly done. Work through them in order — M2 is up next. 🚀

---

## ✅ M0 · Foundations & Debt — `v0.2` — **LIVE**

Our first stop: tidy up the foundations and pay down some debt. It's not glamorous, but future-us will be grateful.

### 1. Tooling

- `.golangci.yml`, gofumpt, `Makefile`/`justfile` (`lint test race fuzz bench`)
- GitHub Actions on **macOS and Linux**, goreleaser snapshot builds, goleak

### 2. Logging — `internal/logging`

- `slog` plus a rotating file writer
- Say goodbye to the swallowed errors in `process.service.go:108,183`

### 3. Config — `internal/config`

- TOML at `~/.config/hive/config.toml` (overridable via `HIVE_CONFIG`)
- Defaults, and validation that warns and falls back instead of failing hard
- `hive config path | show | default`

### 4. CLI

- Move the CLI to **cobra**, keeping the command names you already know; add `hive completion`

### 5. Known bug fixes

- **TUI input ordering** — per-pane writer queue, so keystrokes land in order
- **Disk I/O under the lock** in `ptySession.publish`
- **Kill orphan process groups** in `Recover` and in `Stop` on stale records
- **Serve `stderr` logs**
- **Enforce the version check**
- **Remove the frame-cap risk** on `logs` by streaming it
- **Remove the unused `client.NewModule`**

### 6. Daemon lifecycle

- `hive` auto-starts the daemon detached (`Setsid`, logs to file) plus a pidfile — it should just work
- `hive daemon install` for launchd and systemd user units

### 7. Tests

- Cover the real `ptySession`, `pgroup`, `jsonfile` (add fsync), and `envGuard`

### 8. Spikes — timeboxed to 3 days each

- **(a)** charmbracelet/x/vt against the recorded Claude Code and Codex corpus
- **(b)** Bubble Tea v2 renderer stability and performance with 9 panes
- Write up both results as ADRs so everyone learns from them

**✅ Completed:** CI is green with race and goleak, the daemon auto-starts, no input reordering under a 1k keystrokes/s test, and both ADRs are merged.

---

## ✅ M1 · Terminal Core: VT + Shim + Protocol v2 — `v0.3` — **LIVE**

Now for the heart of the system: a rock-solid terminal core that survives anything you throw at it.

1. **`protocol` v2** — hello/welcome, a mux connection, events, streams, the binary codec; `client` moves to a persistent connection.
2. **`vt`** — port, adapter, a conformance corpus and golden tests, plus a scrollback ring with a byte budget.
3. **`shim`** — server and client. Processes launch through the shim, and the daemon reconnects to shims on start — your agents are never orphaned.
4. **`event` bus** — `events.subscribe` and `events_lost`; the TUI stops polling.
5. **Rendering** — render deltas, keyframe-on-lag policy, PTY resize from clients, and multi-client size arbitration (the last client to interact wins, as in herdr).

**✅ Completed:** `kill -9` the daemon, restart it, and every agent is still running with an identical screen. Reattaching to Claude Code shows a correct screen immediately. With 50 agents producing output and a throttled client, there's no corruption.

---

## M2 · Workspace Model — `v0.4`  — **LIVE**

Let's make it feel like home: named sessions, environments, and a flexible layout that adapts to how you work.

1. **`session`** — named namespaces (`--session`, `HIVE_SESSION`), each with its own socket and state dir.
2. **`environment`** — gains `Root` (an existing dir by default via `hive env create --cwd .`), env vars and git binding; tabs and panes come from `layout`.
3. **`layout` (BSP)** — split, close, zoom, swap, resize, move a pane across tabs and envs without a restart, popups, `layout.export`, `layout.apply`.
4. **`pane` API** — `list / get / split / focus / resize / zoom / swap / move / close / rename / input / send-text / send-keys / run / read (--source visible|recent|recent-unwrapped) / wait-output --regex --timeout`.
5. **`git`** — branch, ahead/behind and dirty state on a timer plus an fs watch; `worktree list|create|open|remove` under `~/.hive/worktrees/<repo>/<branch>`.
6. **Environment injection** — inject `HIVE_PANE_ID`, `HIVE_ENV_ID`, `HIVE_SOCKET_PATH`, `HIVE_BIN`, `TERM_PROGRAM=hive` into panes; strip the outer multiplexer's variables.

---

## M3 · Multiplexer TUI — `v0.5`  — **LIVE**

The fun part: a full multiplexer UI you'll enjoy living in — soon your daily tmux replacement.

1. **Compositor** — renders panes from deltas, with borders, active highlighting, the cursor, and pane titles from OSC.
2. **Sidebar & tabs** — Environments and Agents panels (collapsible; mobile single column at ≤64 columns), a tab bar, and the existing dashboard kept as an **Overview** mode (`prefix+O`).
3. **`keymap`** — prefix key (default `ctrl+b`, configurable, multiple prefixes), modes (terminal, prefix, navigate, resize, copy), `[keys]` in config, a filterable help overlay, and `hive config reset-keys`.
4. **Mouse** — focus, drag splits and the sidebar, wheel scroll into scrollback, select-to-copy, double-click for a word, ctrl-click URLs including OSC 8.
5. **Copy mode** — vim motions, `/` and `?` search with `n`/`N`, visual and line selection, yank to OSC 52 or the local clipboard; `edit_scrollback` opens `$EDITOR`.
6. **Pickers & prompts** — fuzzy Goto picker over agents and panes with state filters, toasts, rename prompts, confirm-close.
7. **Themes** — catppuccin, catppuccin-latte, tokyo-night, gruvbox, nord, `terminal`, plus `[theme.custom]` and auto light/dark. Pick your favorite.

**✅ Acceptance:** you can use Hive daily as a tmux replacement. `teatest` goldens cover each mode. Input latency stays under 10 ms p99 with 16 visible panes.

---

### M4 · Agent intelligence (v0.6) ← **START HERE**

1. `agent` engine: process detection, the `manifest` engine (regions and matchers), report overrides with TTL, the state machine, rollup, and seq counters.
2. Manifests for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini, Cursor Agent, Copilot CLI, Amp and Aider, each with recorded-screen fixtures in tests.
3. `hive agent explain`, `hive server reload-agent-manifests`, and signed remote manifest updates through `update`.
4. `integration install|uninstall|status <agent>`: Claude `settings.json` hooks and Codex `hooks.json` call `hive pane report-agent` to report state and session ID. Writes are idempotent, back up the original file, and are fully reversible.
5. `notify`: toast, terminal (OSC 9/777, which works over SSH), system notifications (osascript or notify-send), and sounds for done and blocked, configurable per agent. Notifications are suppressed for the focused pane.
6. Sidebar state icons, the Overview's RUNNING/AWAITING/COMPLETE counts driven by real states, and `next_agent`/`focus_agent N`/`open_notification_target`.

**Accept:** on the fixture corpus, classification is at least 98 % correct for the top 4 agents. A blocked prompt raises a notification within 500 ms. 100 agents at idle use under 1 % CPU.

## M5 · Agents Operating Agents — `v0.7`

Now it gets really cool: agents driving other agents, through a clean CLI, a Go SDK, and MCP.

1. **Agent CLI** — `agent list | get | start --kind --env --worktree | prompt --wait --until idle|done --timeout | read | wait | send-keys | rename | focus | attach`
  - `prompt` is atomic, uses bracketed paste, refuses while the agent is blocked, and detects stalls.
  - `start --worktree` creates an isolated checkout per agent (a better default than herdr's).
2. **API surface** — `hive api schema`, `hive api snapshot`, and stable `--json` output on every command.
3. **Go SDK** — `pkg/hiveapi`, with examples in `examples/` (a fan-out reviewer, a test-fixer swarm).
4. **MCP** — `hive mcp` stdio server exposing the agent, pane and env tools, so Claude Code can drive it via `claude mcp add hive -- hive mcp`.
5. **Skill** — `skills/hive/SKILL.md`, served by `hive --skill`.

**✅ Acceptance:** a Claude Code instance inside Hive can spawn 3 Codex agents in worktrees, prompt them, wait for them and collect their output using only MCP. This runs as an e2e test against a fake agent binary.

---

## M6 · Persistence & Resume — `v0.8`

Reboots happen. Hive should shrug them off and pick up right where you left off.

1. **`persist`** — `session.json` snapshots, debounced on change, keeping the last 48 rotated, with backups of corrupt files and a schema version.
2. **Restore after host reboot** — envs, tabs, panes, cwd, layout and focus; agents resume through their native IDs (`claude --resume <id>`, `codex resume <id>`) with a staggered start (`session.resume_agents_on_restore`).
3. **Pane history replay** — optional, off by default, with secret-safety docs.
4. **Shutdown safety** — Linux logind delay inhibitor; on macOS, snapshot on `NSWorkspaceWillPowerOff` via a signal path, or on a timer.
5. **Housekeeping** — log rotation, retention config, `hive gc`.
6. **Self-update** — `hive update` swaps the binary and restarts the daemon; shims keep running, giving zero-downtime upgrades.

**✅ Acceptance:** reboot the VM and all 10 Claude and Codex panes are restored and resumed. Upgrading during active output loses no bytes.

---

## M7 · Remote & Multi-Machine — `v0.9`

Go beyond one machine: SSH in and manage a whole fleet of agents from wherever you are.

1. **SSH transport** — `client.Dial` over SSH; `ssh host hive proxy --session X` acts as a stdio bridge, with ControlMaster and keepalives configured.
2. **Bootstrap** — `hive --remote host` checks the remote version and installs or updates it after confirmation (copying its own binary when the OS and architecture match).
3. **Saved machines** — `machine add | list | rename | enable | disable | remove | status | reconnect`; the sidebar merges agents from every machine, and `--machine` forwards API calls.
4. **Bandwidth** — deflate on the frame stream, a per-client frame budget, and coalescing driven by the RTT the client reports; target under 50 MB/h per busy pane.
5. **Remote clipboard** — OSC 52 over remote. The image paste bridge arrives later (post-1.0).

**✅ Acceptance:** 5 remote machines and 40 agents run for 8 hours without growth in latency or memory (soak test).

---

## M8 · Extensibility — `v0.10`

Make Hive yours: plugins, custom commands, and hooks for whatever your workflow needs.

1. **`plugin`** — a `hive-plugin.toml` manifest with id, version, `min_hive_version`, platforms, `[[startup]]`, `[[actions]]`, `[[events]]`; install from git with a trust preview, plus link, enable, disable and uninstall; `HIVE_PLUGIN_*` env and a context JSON are injected.
2. **Custom commands** — `[[keys.command]]` (popup, pane, shell, plugin\_action).
3. **Metadata** — `report-metadata` tokens and title in the sidebar, with TTL.
4. **Status bar** — right area: text, datetime, hostname, and a command on an interval.

**✅ Acceptance:** two reference plugins (a "PR status" sidebar token and "spawn reviewer on worktree.created") work end to end.

---

## M9 · Hardening → `v1.0.0`

The final stretch: freeze the APIs, polish the rough edges, and ship a 1.0 we can all be proud of. 🎉

1. **API freeze** — audit `api/v1`, `pkg/hiveapi` and the config keys; write a compatibility policy doc.
2. **Performance** — run the benchmark suite; reach 100 panes with p99 frame under 16 ms and idle CPU under 1 %; profile with pprof, available behind `hive debug pprof`.
3. **Reliability** — fuzzers run 24 h in nightly CI, a 72 h chaos soak (kill shims and the daemon, drop the network), and fd and goroutine leak checks.
4. **Security** — socket perms 0600 with peer-cred UID checks (`SO_PEERCRED`/`getpeereid`), signed manifest and update verification, a plugin trust prompt, `gosec`, and an updated `SECURITY.md`.
5. **Distribution** — goreleaser for darwin and linux on amd64 and arm64, `install.sh`, a Homebrew tap, a Nix flake, `hive update`, stable/preview channels.
6. **Docs** — quick start, concepts, keybindings, the config reference generated from `config` structs, the API reference generated from the schema, agent guides, and the herdr→Hive migration guide (including importing herdr config and keys).
7. **RC cycle** — `v1.0.0-rc.1` … `rc.N`, with 2 weeks of no P0/P1 bugs, then **v1.0.0**.

- **Windows** — ConPTY via `platform/windows`
- **Kitty graphics passthrough**
- **Image paste bridge**
- **Plugin panes and link handlers**
- **Plugin marketplace index**
- **Web and mobile observer UI** — built on `terminal session observe`
- **mDNS machine discovery**
- **Hosted offering**
